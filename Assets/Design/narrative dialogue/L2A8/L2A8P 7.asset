  DialogueText: Then all I have done ...all I have feared is true, I am no leader,
    I am nought but a false prophet. all I wanted was to save them, to save as many
    as I could, to lead them to salvation, to safety. I ... I could have done more.
    If I had made them leave sooner if I had led them south, we could have avoided
    the fire. I ... I could have done better
